  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>Hi there! I am a second year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. I am working under the supervision of <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~tozsu/">Prof. M. Tamer Özsu</a> as a member of the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/data-systems-group/">Data Systems Group</a>. 
      I am broadly interested in building and optimizing data systems for large language model (LLM) workloads.
