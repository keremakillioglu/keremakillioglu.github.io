Welcome to my blog! I am using jekyll-now to build this blog - it's basically a static website generator for Github Pages.

It's been a while since I wanted to start a blog and here's my final attempt. Hopefully, I keep up this time. Here is a non exhaustive list of topics I will write about.

- Technology
- Great products
- Software engineering
- Travelling
- Music
- Games

With that said, echo hello world!
