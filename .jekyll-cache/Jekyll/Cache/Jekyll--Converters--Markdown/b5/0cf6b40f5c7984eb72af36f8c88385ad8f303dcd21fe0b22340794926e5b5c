I"N<p>My masterâ€™s thesis is on cardinality estimation in Streaming Graph Data Management Systems (SGDMS). I have been developing a novel cardinality estimation technique on top of the <a href="https://dsg-uwaterloo.github.io/s-graffito/">S-Graffito</a> project, where my research group built a SGDMS that addresses the processing of OLTP and OLAP queries. I am enthusiastic about this project since I am contributing to the development of the first query optimizer that is native to streaming graph databases, and we are taking the first steps in building complete graph native systems.</p>
