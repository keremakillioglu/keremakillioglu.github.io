I"¸<p>In June 2020, I graduated from Sabanci University with a Computer Science degree. I had the happiness of completing this valuable chapter of my life. 
A week after my graduation, I took my first steps into my profession. When I look back, I see the importance of every decision I made, 
the significance of every effort I put and the influence of every relationship I built. I decided to write down some key points about my journey.</p>
