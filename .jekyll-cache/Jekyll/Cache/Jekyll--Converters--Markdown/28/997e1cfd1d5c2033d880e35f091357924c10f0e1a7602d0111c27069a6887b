I"ø<p>Welcome to my blog! I am using jekyll-now to build this blog - itâ€™s basically a static website generator for Github Pages.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s been a while since I wanted to start a blog and hereâ€™s my final attempt. Hopefully, I keep up this time. Here is a non exhaustive list of topics I will write about.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Technology</li>
  <li>Great products</li>
  <li>Software engineering</li>
  <li>Travelling</li>
  <li>Music</li>
  <li>Games</li>
</ul>

<p>With that said, echo hello world!</p>
