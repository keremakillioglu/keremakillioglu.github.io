I"½<p>My masterâ€™s thesis is on cardinality estimation in Streaming Graph Data Management Systems (SGDMS). I have been developing a novel cardinality estimation technique on top of the <a href="https://dsg-uwaterloo.github.io/s-graffito/">S-Graffito</a> project, where my research group built a SGDMS that addresses the processing of OLTP and OLAP queries. I am enthusiastic about this project since I am contributing to the development of the first query optimizer that is native to streaming graph databases, and we are taking the first steps in building complete graph native systems.</p>

<p>In my masterâ€™s thesis, I have been building a logically simple and computationally efficient system. Using sliding windows as a method to address the constraints of the streaming environment, I summarized the data within the windows into a sketch and developed a novel method to estimate cardinality. I appreciate the simplicity of my estimation technique as it applies fundamental estimation techniques used in relational systems. Yet, the end-to-end solution is flexible and powerful enough to control for accuracy and efficiency.</p>

<p>I am still in the process of completing the project as of this writing.</p>
